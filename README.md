Code to control a 3 speed ceiling fan and light as a smart device and have voice control through Amazon echo.  I use the belken wemo  emulator code  found in various places on the internet. with voice you can turn on Fan High, Fan Medium, Fan Low, Fan Light.   to make it easy calling out to turn off any speed turns the fan completely off so you don't have to guess what speed is on. (if fan high is on and you say turn off fan medium, the fan shuts off)
make sure you change your SSID and password so it connects to your network.
